# Spooky_author_competition
Folder with an lstm model on keras for the spooky author competition
This wrapper was made mainly because I wanted to learn how to build an lstm for text classification. The parameters used were not optimized fully, as this was more of a learning excercice to build the algorithm. The wrapper here is just used to make ones life easier.
To run it, You must have the train and test csv from the spooky author competition on kaggle (or any text classification problem in a similar format, change the path accordingly and just run the lstm.wrapper.py. The minimum I could get with the loss function was 0.47303 but my submission was too late to be taken into account. This is by far not the best optimisation ever, as the point was just to exercise myself using lstm.
